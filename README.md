## What is Macadam?

Macadam is an advanced, offline-first dashboard for multi-apping delivery drivers (DoorDash, Uber Eats, Skip, Instacart, etc.). It helps you track your true net hourly rate, vehicle expenses, tax obligations, and goal streaks—all without your data ever leaving your device.

By treating gig work like a real business, Macadam gives you the same analytics an office worker takes for granted, tailored to the realities of delivery logistics.

## ⚡️ Features

* **Multi-App Intelligence**: Define which platforms you run. Macadam understands their unique terms (Peak Pay vs. Surge) and provides platform-specific form fields.
* **True Net Earnings**: Auto-calculates your real hourly rate after fuel, maintenance, and vehicle depreciation.
* **Tax Peace of Mind**: Computes suggested tax set-asides based on your region, handles Canadian HST tracking, and isolates deductible business expenses.
* **Gamification & Goals**: Set weekly earnings targets, maintain streaks, and unlock achievement badges.
* **100% Offline & Private**: Built on IndexedDB and a custom Service Worker. It works in dead zones, and your financial data never hits a cloud server.
* **Blazing Fast**: Vanilla JavaScript and CSS. Zero framework overhead.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+) solely for the local build server.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/raiz-toff/macadam.git
cd macadam

# 2. Install dev dependencies (esbuild)
npm install

# 3. Start the dev server in watch mode
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port `serve` assigns) in your browser.

> **Tip:** You can install Macadam as a standalone app on your phone or desktop directly from your browser (PWA).

## 🏗 Tech Stack

Macadam is an exercise in stripping away modern web bloat:

* **No Frameworks**: 100% Vanilla JS (ES2022) and Vanilla CSS.
* **Database**: `Dexie.js` wrapping IndexedDB for powerful client-side querying.
* **Bundler**: `esbuild` for instant builds.
* **Charts**: `Chart.js` (vendored).
* **Routing**: Simple hash-based router.
* **PWA**: Custom, hand-written Service Worker (no Workbox black boxes).
